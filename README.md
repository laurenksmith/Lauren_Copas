## Hi, I’m Lauren! 👋

After 15 years as a teacher, I decided to follow my love for problem-solving and puzzles into the world of tech. 🧩 I’m currently transitioning into software and data engineering, and loving every second of working out how things tick under the hood.

I earned a Distinction in both the Data & Software Engineering and the DevOps & Cloud +Masters courses through Code First Girls (CFG). 🎓 These experiences gave me a strong foundation in Python, SQL, cloud technologies, and the joy of endlessly debugging things until they work (and then doing a little happy dance 💃).

## My projects so far include:

### Completed:

#### **<ins>Moneybags</ins>**
A budgeting app I, alongside my project teammates in CFG, built from scratch to simplify saving and spending tracking.

#### **<ins>A Sorted Tale</ins>**
I completed this project through Codecademy. I was tasked with taking an eccentric bookshop owner's unusual ways of organising his bookshelves and finding a quicker way for him to work out which books belong where.

#### **<ins>Habit Tracking App</ins>**
I created a simple app which allows the user to log daily habits, track these habits and create a 'streak' for encouragement!

### Currently Working On:

#### **<ins>Knickerbricker Glory</ins>**
Currently building a website for my husband’s bespoke Lego model instructions business 🛩️🚂 alongside my brother (my frontend support). This is a big one, as I am creating an online database of all his model instructions (hundreds of them - wish I'd started this sooner!), an authentication API to keep the data secure, and teaching myself how to incorporate a payment app.

#### **<ins>Book Tracker</ins>**
I'm starting to create an app where the user would be able to log books that they've read using the title, author, genre and also rate each book. I would then like the user to be able to search for or sort these books e.g. by genre or rating.



🫠 *I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient solutions, and I'm always curious to dig deeper and learn more. Whether it's solving a tricky bug, designing a database, or figuring out how a system fits together, I love the challenge!*

**Tech skills:** Python, SQL, a sprinkle of JavaScript, and growing knowledge of DevOps, cloud platforms, and relational databases.🫠

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me building something – whether it’s with code, bricks, or way too much coffee. ☕ Let's connect!
