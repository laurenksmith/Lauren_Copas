Hi, I’m Lauren! 👋

After 15 years as a teacher, I decided to follow my love for problem-solving and puzzles into the world of tech. 🧩 I’m currently transitioning into software and data engineering, and loving every second of working out how things tick under the hood.

I earned a Distinction in both the Data & Software Engineering and the DevOps & Cloud +Masters courses through Code First Girls (CFG). 🎓 These experiences gave me a strong foundation in Python, SQL, cloud technologies, and the joy of endlessly debugging things until they work (and then doing a little happy dance 💃).

My projects so far include:

Moneybags – a budgeting app I, alongside my project teammates in CFG, built from scratch to simplify saving and spending tracking.

Knickerbricker Glory – currently building a website for my husband’s business creating bespoke Lego model instructions 🛩️🚂 alongside my brother.

I'm passionate about creating clean, efficient solutions, and I'm always curious to dig deeper and learn more. Whether it's solving a tricky bug, designing a database, or figuring out how a system fits together, I love the challenge!

Tech skills: Python, SQL, a sprinkle of JavaScript, and growing knowledge of DevOps, cloud platforms, and relational databases.

Outside of tech, you’ll usually find me building something – whether it’s with code, bricks, or way too much coffee. ☕ Let's connect!
